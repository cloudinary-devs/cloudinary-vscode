## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **Visual Studio Code** (latest version)
- **Git**

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   # Fork the repo on GitHub, then clone your fork
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cloudinary-vscode.git
   cd cloudinary-vscode
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up Cloudinary credentials**
   Create a global configuration file at:
   - macOS/Linux: `~/.cloudinary/environments.json`
   - Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.cloudinary\environments.json`

   ```json
   {
     "test-cloud": {
       "apiKey": "your-test-api-key",
       "apiSecret": "your-test-api-secret",
       "uploadPreset": "your-test-upload-preset"
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Build the extension**
   ```bash
   npm run compile
   ```

5. **Run the extension**
   - Press `F5` in VS Code to launch a new Extension Development Host window
   - Test your changes in this new window


## Development Workflow

### Building

- **Compile TypeScript**: `npm run compile`
- **Watch mode** (auto-compile on changes): `npm run watch`
- **Prepare for publishing**: `npm run vscode:prepublish`

### Running and Testing

1. **Launch Extension Development Host**:
   - Open the project in VS Code
   - Press `F5` or run "Debug: Start Debugging"
   - This opens a new VS Code window with your extension loaded

2. **Test your changes**:
   - Open the Cloudinary view in the Activity Bar
   - Test various commands and functionality
   - Check the Debug Console for logs and errors

3. **Reload extension** (after code changes):
   - In the Extension Development Host window, press `Ctrl+R` / `Cmd+R`
   - Or use "Developer: Reload Window" command


### VS Code Integration

- Use the built-in VS Code extension APIs
- Follow VS Code's UX guidelines for consistency
- Handle errors gracefully with user-friendly messages

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Follow the code style guidelines
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation if needed


3. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature description"
   ```

4. **Push to your fork**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

5. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Go to GitHub and create a PR from your fork
   - Fill out the PR template completely
   - Link any related issues
